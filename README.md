## General Information

In this project, I will **learn Haskell**, or I will try at least. This
is my first objective.

[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a *purely functional language*
that is:

* **statically typed**, that is every expression in Haskell is determined at
  compile time.
   
* **purely functional**. Every function in Haskell is a function in
mathematical sense. The result of a expression only depends of the 
values of its inputs without any side-effect.

* **type inference**.

* **concurrent**.

* **lazy**.

I have other objectives with this project.

* tools for developing a project, that includes:
  * Create, adding packages, resolve dependencies with
    [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).
  * Documenting source code
    [Haddock](https://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html).
  * Testing code. Several options like:
    * [QuickCheck](http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/)
    * [HSpec](https://hspec.github.io/)
    * others test frameworks 
  * Using a source distribution source code like [Git](https://git-scm.com).
  * Writing technical docs like README, Changelog, manuals.
* Improve my skills in writing English, technical English at least.
* Improve my skills with vim, actually nvim.

## Credits

There is a ton of good books, tutorials and so about Haskell. I read several of them.
This work is based in:
