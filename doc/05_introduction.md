# Introduction to Haskell

In [How to learn Haskell](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell)
recommends [Yorgey's cis194](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html)
that I use as a guide.

In this document, Yorgey recommends two readings:
 
-   [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good, chapter 2](http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out)
-   [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/),
    chapters 1 and 2

I try to read them too. I have the book "Programming Haskell". I read this, too.

* Code from Yorgey's cis194 course is under `cis194/` directory.
* Code from "Real World Haskell" is under `realhw/` directory
* Code from "Learn you Haskell for Great Good" is in `baby.hs`
